# 👋 Hi, I’m Sarah!

🎓 I'm a Mechanical Engineering student at **UDESC**, passionate about structural analysis and programming.  
🔧 I’m particularly interested in **topology optimization** and how it can revolutionize **3D frame structures**.

## 👀 I’m interested in:
- **Optimization techniques** that push the boundaries of engineering design
- **Programming** (especially in Julia and Python) for engineering applications
- Anything that combines **innovation** with **sustainability**  

## 🌱 I’m currently learning:
- Advanced **topology optimization** for structural elements
- New ways to **apply optimization in 3D frames** through my research project
- Growing my skills on **GitHub** for better project collaboration and management

## 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on:
- Projects involving **engineering simulation, optimization**, or **machine learning applications** in mechanical systems
- Open-source initiatives that aim to **improve structural design** or **solve real-world engineering problems**

## 📫 How to reach me:
Feel free to connect with me on **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/)** or reach out via **email**!

## 😄 Pronouns:
She/Her

## ⚡ Fun fact:
I’m a huge fan of **Aurora** (the singer 🌌), and I also play the **ukulele** in my spare time. 🎶
